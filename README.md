# Azure Sentinel (SIEM) Project

## Objective
The Azure Sentinel (SIEM) project focused on enhancing security operations by leveraging Azure Sentinel, Microsoft's cloud-based Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution. The project involved two key objectives:

1. **Custom PowerShell Scripting for Metadata Extraction:** Utilized custom PowerShell scripts to extract metadata from the Windows Event Viewer. This metadata was then forwarded to a third-party API to derive geolocation data, enhancing the context and analysis of security events.

2. **Azure Sentinel Workbook Configuration:** Configured Azure Sentinel workbooks to visualize global attack data, specifically focusing on Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) brute force attacks. The workbook displayed attack data on a world map, showcasing the physical location and magnitude of attacks for improved situational awareness and response.

### Skills Learned
- Development of custom PowerShell scripts for data extraction and automation.
- Integration of third-party APIs to enrich security event data.
- Configuration and customization of Azure Sentinel workbooks for data visualization.
- Understanding of global attack patterns, particularly focusing on RDP brute force attacks.
- Enhanced proficiency in analyzing and responding to security incidents using Azure Sentinel.

### Tools Used
- PowerShell scripting for metadata extraction.
- Azure Sentinel for centralized security event monitoring and analysis.
- Third-party API for enriching event data with geolocation information.
- Azure Sentinel workbooks for visualizing and analyzing security data.
